Doug: We help companies recruit world-class engineers early on. If you miss on your first two engineers, it’s very hard to recover. Tracy: We want to show the world how to build a company that takes care of its employees and provides undeniable value to its customers.  Doug: Write your values in pen, and your strategies and tactics in pencil. Tracy: Surround yourself with people you can learn from. Believe in yourself and dive into areas you don’t know. Grow. Doug: Should you pursue bright founders or a big market? That's a false choice. Great founders find their way to great markets. Doug: Look for a VC who is founder-focused, ",
